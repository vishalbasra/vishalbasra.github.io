This site

I do not take full creative ownership for this site's theme / visual representations. 
This site is running on Jekyll ( and now on Github pages! ) and uses the [hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) theme which in turn is based on [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) which is based on [poole](http://getpoole.com/) 
I have adapted this theme and modified it as it suited me, but I am not responsible for it's ownership , inception and creation in any way. 

Full credit to the authors for making ( and enhancing ) this awesome theme.
