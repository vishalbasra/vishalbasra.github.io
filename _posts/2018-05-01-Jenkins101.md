excerpt: Jenkins 101
---

Jenkins problems :
  - CD creates jobs ( sol - add a jenkinsfile to your repo )
  - can't edit the job myself :sadpanda: ( sol - PR against jenkinsfile )
  - PR builders i.e see your commit status before merging a PR i.e more Jenkins jobs ( sol - instead do that in jenkins as a tool and not make independent jobs for it )
  - Dependencies which aren't installed on slaves ( sol - run build on dockers )

Current status:
   - OSS/Nucleus/CC uses jenkinsfiles
   - Declarative pipelines offer a simple DSL to define jobs ( this is in ruby lol )
   - easy to read than scripts/vanilla groovy

Other things
    - Multi-branch | tool/plugin to create sub-jobs for a main repo and for pull requests
    - Declarative Pipeline ruby thingy
    - BitBucket Branch plugin thingy
    - Bitbucket team/project -plugin and a new version of jenkins both may be needed
    - Pull Requests something / but-cucket - Org level branching and stuff
