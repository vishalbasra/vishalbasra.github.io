excerpt: A first step at learning Java!

Hi!

In this post I'll be trying to write aboiut how I learned to write Java and my first Java program.


My use-case :- 
1. Learn and understand how to run Java
2. Learn and understand how to write a basic Java program
3. See how DNS lookups work in Java
4. Watch out for an __UnknownHost__ exception within my DNS environment and find out if there are errors
5. Log the output to a file and STDOUT
6. Notify me in case an error occurs
7. Run this program in a way that isn't super shitty

**DISCLAIMER** This is in no ways a perfect program and neither is it 100% complete, this is how I learnt to figure out DNS related errors in my environment from Java services


## How to install Java

1. You want to install two packages `Java` and `Java-devel` based on your distrubition. 
   For RHEL/CentOs like machines this becomes `sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel`

2. Verify your java version and java compiler version (`javac`) like this 
   - `java -version`
   - `javac -version`

## How to write a basic Java program 
1. Make a file called `HelloWorld.java` in a directory and `cd` to there
   Add whatever you want to in the file , say
```
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to STDOUT
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}


```

2. Compile it using the java compiler - `javac HelloWorld.java` ; this will create a `.class` file

3. Verify and run the compiled class file as - `java HelloWorld`

4. Make a mainfest file called manifest.mf ; this will tell your application which class to look for as the default
`echo Main-Class: HelloWorld > manifest.mf`

5. Create the JAR file
`jar cvfm HelloWorld.jar manifest.mf *.class`

6. Make the JAR executable
`chmod 744 HelloWorld.jar`

6. Run the test file as :-
`java -jar /tmp/HelloWorld.jar`
