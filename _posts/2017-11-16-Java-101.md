excerpt: A first step at learning Java!
---

Hi!

In this post I'll be trying to write aboiut how I learned to write Java and my first Java program.


My use-case :- 
1. Learn and understand how to run Java
2. Learn and understand how to write a basic Java program
3. See how DNS lookups work in Java
4. Watch out for an __UnknownHost__ exception within my DNS environment and find out if there are errors
5. Log the output to a file and STDOUT
6. Notify me in case an error occurs
7. Run this program in a way that isn't super shitty

**DISCLAIMER** This is in no ways a perfect program and neither is it 100% complete, this is how I learnt to figure out DNS related errors in my environment from Java services


## How to install Java

1. You want to install two packages `Java` and `Java-devel` based on your distrubition. 
   For RHEL/CentOs like machines this becomes `sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel`

2. Verify your java version and java compiler version (`javac`) like this 
   - `java -version`
   - `javac -version`

## How to write a basic Java program 
1. Make a file called `HelloWorld.java` in a directory and `cd` to there
   Add whatever you want to in the file , say
{% highlight java %}
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to STDOUT
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

2. Compile it using the java compiler - `javac HelloWorld.java` ; this will create a `.class` file

3. Verify and run the compiled class file as - `java HelloWorld`

4. Make a mainfest file called manifest.mf ; this will tell your application which class to look for as the default
`echo Main-Class: HelloWorld > manifest.mf`

5. Create the JAR file
`jar cvfm HelloWorld.jar manifest.mf *.class`

6. Make the JAR executable
`chmod 744 HelloWorld.jar`

6. Run the test file as :-
`java -jar /tmp/HelloWorld.jar`


## How to run a Java program acceptable(ishly) for this test
 Do not **cron** it!
Instead, use `screen` see `man screen`. 
To run it in the background :-
- `yum -y install screen`

- `screen -l java -jar /opt/java-test/lookupTest.jar >> /var/log/lookupTest-RAW.log ; if [ -e /var/log/Java-DNS-Lookup.log.1 ] ; then rm -f /var/log/Java-DNS-Lookup.log.* ;fi`

- detach that screen `control + a + d` or `screen -d <screen ID>` to find the id, do `screen -ls` 

To terminate, find and kill the process

 ( The last part of removing extra log files is because I don't know how to code properly. (It's inefficient, but works ) )

 Now there will be two log files that you can assess :-

- One at `/var/log/lookupTest-RAW.log` which is the complete standard output of the program

- The other at `/var/log/Java-DNS-Lookup.log` which contains a simple status of if the lookup was sucessful or not. (This file is taken care of by the program itself)

## Lets get down to business and see how it works!

The code is fairly easy and simple to understand, i've hoped that I've used enough comments for it to be readable.
