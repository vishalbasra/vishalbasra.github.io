			"Ask for help when needed"
			"Don't be overconfident"
			"Don't be under-confident"

		},
		"Project Specific Knowledge":{
			"Architecture":{
				"Documentation":{
					"Accessible" : "Every-body should be able to access it. Send it to participants before the meeting.",
					"Simple": "It should be simple to understand. Rule of Thumb - Simple enough for a new participant to understand clearly.",
					"Easy to read": "Well-written, diagrams, figures, labels, headers, paragraphs, fonts should all make it an 'easy read'"
				},
				"Design Approach":{
					"Documentation":{
						"Present?" : "Is the Design Approach well-documented?"
					},
					"Simplicity": "The idea of the project whether new or an existing one should be easy to understand",
					"Reason": "Why are we doing this? This needs to be the first fact stated and explained if not done already.",
					"Impact": "What will be the impact of this project?",
					"Outcome": "What are the advantages or disadvantages of doing something this way or that way.",
					"Future proof-ness": "Is the project future-proof, modern, will we have to do 'something new' in another two years?",
					"Scalability" : "How scalable is the project?",
					"(High) Availability" :"Does the design incorporate this?",

				"Are there certain positive aspects that you know will come up (from certain people or otherwise)?": "Are they emphasized?"

			}
		},
		"Feedback Ability":{
			"Negative Feedback" : "How well can you receive negative feedback. Rule of thumb - in long term there's nothing as 'negative feedback'",
			"Positive Feedback" : "Do you understand why was the feedback positive - because of the work or a person? Rule of thumb - There's nothing as 'positive feedback' either. It's just agreement.",
			"Golden Rule of Thumb" : "Don't really (for the long-term) perceive feedback as +ve or -ve ; Feedback may be +ve or -ve for the project, but never for you. Keep learning from it and it'll be what it is, just 'feedback' Ref: Waterfall model."

		}

			"List them"

		},
		"Negative Points Discussed?":{
			"List them"
