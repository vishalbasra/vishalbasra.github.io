## See Run-Lists of multiple nodes ##
{: id="runlists"}

This can be used to
- see order of cookbooks on the nodes
- other interesting stuff on the run-lsit itself of the node!

| S.No        | Action  | Command  |
| 1.     | Get list of nodes you want to query on |    `knife search node "chef_environment:testing" -i > node-list.txt`   |
| 2.     | Make a directory |    `mkdir run-lists`   |
| 2.     | Save the run-lists of nodes you want to query on |    `for i in `cat node_todo.txt` ; do knife node show -F json $i > run-lists/$i.json ; done`   |
| 3.     | Do `bash` magic eg; to see order of cookbooks linux and windows after `cd run-lists` |    `for i in `ls -l \| grep -v './'   \| awk '{ print $9 }'` ; do echo $i && grep -ni 'linux' $i && grep -ni 'windows' $i ; done > /tmp/order.txt`   |


## Client VS Node ##
{: id="clients-nodes"}

A `client` -  is a user that will authenticate against the Chef server to do something
A `node`   -  is a machine that uses data from the Chef server to configure itself.


A `client` will have the level of permission to access data from the Chef server
A `node` will get the list of recipies / cookbooks to be run

 
Consider a webserver `web1.awesomehost.com` , when it connects to chef-server to get all the recipies needed for `web1.awesomehost.com` it says "Hello Chef Server, I am client `web1.awesomehost.com` and here, I can authenticate to you, I need the `recipies` / `run-list` / `node-object` etc. for the `node` `web1.awesomehost.com` please pass them along.
